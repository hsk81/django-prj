django-prj
==========

Sets a basic development environment for [django](http://djangoproject.com) up
using [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.org). After cloning the repository just
execute

    ./setup.sh $PRJNAME

where $PRJNAME should be the name of your project. The `pipit` function inside
`setup.sh` should be extended with the dependencies you require. If you need to
update your dependencies then execute

    ./setup.sh $PRJNAME --upgrade

and all your dependencies will be upgraded (using `pip install --upgrade`). If
you need to get rid of your virtual enviroment then execute

    ./setup.sh clear.

After cloning this repository and executing `./setup.sh $PRJNAME` the `origin`
remote of the git repository should be removed with

    git remote rm origin

and probably replaced with a URL of your own liking.
